  |   The squid kids called Inklings are back to splat more ink and         |
  |   claim more turf in this colorful and chaotic 4-on-4 action shooter.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   For the first time, take Turf War battles on-the-go with the          |
  |   Nintendo Switch system, and use any of the console's portable play    |
  |   styles for intense local multiplayer action.                          |
  |   Even team up for new 4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!                |
  |   Two years have passed since the original Splatoon game was            |
  |   released and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a     |
  |   fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear.           |
